       <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
       <p>
           HTML(<span class="underline">H</span>yper<span class="underline">T</span>ext <span class="underline">M</span>arkup<span class="underline">L</span>anguge) is the code that is
           used to structure a webpage and it's content.For example,
           content could be structured within a set of paragraphs,a list
           of bulleted points or using images and data tables.

       <h2> So what is HTML?</h2>
       <P>
           HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content.It consists of a series of 
           elements which you use to enclose,or wrap diffent parts of the content to make it appear or act a
           certain way.For example,if we wanted a line to stand by itself,we could specify that it is a 
           paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags.

       <p>
           The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
           <ol>
               <li>
                   <strong>opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element(e.g),wrapped in opening and closing angle
                   brackets.This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.</li>
               <li>
                   <strong>The closing tag:</strong>This is the same as the opening tag,except that it includes a forward slash before the
                   element name.This states where the element ends-in this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
               <li>Other.</li>
           </ol>
       <h3>Summary</h3>
       <P>
           HTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and content of a webpage,it says what comes on a
           webpage.An HTML document is made up of series of elements.Some elements we covered in this lesson include;
       <ul>
        <li>Heading tag(s)</li>
        <li>Paragraph</li>
        <li>tags</li> 
        <li>Image</li>
        <li>Hyper references (links)</li>
       </ul>
